# ✅ Flutter Todo App

My **first Flutter project** 🎉 – a simple and elegant **Todo Application** built with **Flutter**, **Riverpod (state management)**, and **Slidable (for swipe actions)**.

This app allows users to **add, complete, and delete todos** with a clean UI.  
It helped me learn **state management, navigation, and UI design in Flutter**.
